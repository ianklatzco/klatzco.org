      <h1> Positive Changes and Economic Development We Bring to the Village</h1>
        <p>In the last four years we have seen many changes to our Village. Our street lights have been replaced with new energy efficient LED lighting on Lincoln and Crawford Avenues; Touhy will be completed this summer. The street lights on secondary streets throughout the Village have been upgraded to LEDs by ComEd, at no cost to the residents. These changes will save us thousands of dollars a year on our electric bills. In addition, we are about to secure a new water source to get out of the City of Chicago’s continual price hikes.</p>

        <p>We have resurfaced Pratt Avenue and added a new traffic signal at Central. We constructed two new bike and hiking trails, all paid for with grant money that greatly reduced the cost to residents. Crawford Ave has been completely rebuilt with new sewers and water mains. We have started the storm water pilot program on the east side of town and are working on adding a additional storm water outlet to the canal to help alleviate flooding.</p>

        <p>New additions to town include Meatheads, 90 Miles to Cuba, Binnys Beverage Depot, a new standalone AT&T store, and a reopened Long John Silver’s. The shuttered Kow Kow restaurant has been sold and a new high-end restaurant is coming to the site. We will continue talking with developers to try and bring a grocery store to town.</p>
        
        <p>We are expecting construction of a new Hyatt hotel on Cicero. And after many years of standing vacant, the Bell and Howell property on Pratt Ave is being developed with a senior housing and memory care facility. The development includes a ambulance substation that will reduce the response time to the east side of town.</p>

        <p>We continue to upgrade our parks and add greenspace to our community. Starting this summer we will tear out the asphalt and begin beautifying the center islands on Lincoln Ave, from Jarvis to Devon.</p>

        <p>The Village has received a grant and is partnering with the City of Chicago to upgrade the streetscape on Devon Avenue from McCormick to Lincoln. This will beautify the area, make it more attractive for the residents, and hopefully bring new business.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the largest property to be developed in our village has stalled. Our Mayor, trustees and staff worked tirelessly with the developer to help the project come to fruition, but the developer has gone into foreclosure. The village has decided to be proactive and take the appropriate actions to move things along.</p>

        <p>As you look up around our village, you can see lots of positive changes coming to Lincolnwood. We are working on filling the abandoned properties and unsustainable businesses throughout the village. We believe our village has a lot to offer and we can revitalize our town. As trustee I will ensure there is a long-term sustainable vision that is compatible with our community, builds our tax base, and creates jobs.</p>
 
        <h2>Increasing Transparency and Communication</h2>
        <p> During my term we have began televising the Committee of the Whole meetings and streaming them online. All past meeting videos are stored on our website where residents can choose to view any. We have created a new mobile app that the residents can request services, report violations, check our village calendar, watch LWD TV on demand, and pay bills. We also started an email alert system where residents can sign up to get updates and reminders about what is going on in the village. These changes help to make our government process open and more transparent.</p>
         
        <h2>Observing Fiscal Responsibility Fighting for Lower Taxes and Fees</h2>
        <p>Our Village has one of the lowest tax rates in the area, we continue our policy of keeping our tax rate no greater that the tax cap. As trustee I continue to reduce the cost of government through fiscal responsibility and provide transparency of our taxes and fees. I do not believe that local government needs to have aggressive "tax-and-spend" policies to pursue the interests of the village; rather our actions should favor fiscal responsibility. Investment in our village is important. While financing these projects we must explore all avenues of funding, such as federal/state grants and creative tax options that will not burden our residents. As a businessperson, I understand the value of a dollar. As Chairman of the Finance Committee we continue to enjoy a sound fiscal policy with budgetary management and fiscal responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Supporting Local Businesses </h2>
        <p>As a Lincolnwood business owner for the past 45 years, I understand the challenges of operating a business. As trustee, I am committed to treating all businesses with equal respect and doing everything I can to encourage a stronger business community. I believe that when businesses succeed, our Village benefits.  </p>

        <h2>Improved Relations with the School and Library Districts </h2>
        <p>In the past four years our village board and staff have bolstered our relationship and worked with our schools and library to ensure our residents get the best services.</p>
