        <p align="left"><font size="+2"><b><font size="+1">Supporting Local Businesses</font></b><font size="+1"><br>
          As a Lincolnwood business owner for the past 40 years, I directly understand 
          the challenges of operating a business. Whether you agree with all our 
          Village ordinances or not, most would agree that they should be administered 
          fairly and without bias. The current board has approved exemptions for 
          some businesses while forcing others to comply with special provisions 
          above and beyond requirements. As trustee, I am committed to treating 
          all businesses with respect and doing everything I can to encourage 
          a stronger business community. I believe that when businesses succeed, 
          the</font></font><font size="+1">Village benefits the greatest.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1"><br>
          <b>Fighting for Lower Taxes and Fees</b><br>
          While our Village has long touted in their mailings that Lincolnwood 
          has one of the lowest tax rates in the area, what they haven't talked 
          about is the ever increasing list of fees. Our Village builds its coffers 
          not only from our property and sales taxes but they have long collected 
          fees on our phone, cable, water and electric bills. In fact, they recently 
          added a sewer fee and a red light camera to generate even more revenue. 
          As trustee I will seek to reduce the cost of government and provide 
          more transparency to our taxes and fees.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1"><br>
          <b>Observing Fiscal Responsibility</b><br>
          I do not believe that local government needs to have aggressive &quot;tax-and-spend&quot; 
          policies to pursue the interests of the village; rather our actions 
          should favor fiscal responsibility. Investment in our village is important 
          but financing projects with bonds needs to be seriously reviewed, lest 
          we leave our children with our debts. As a businessperson, I understand 
          the value of a dollar. Under my direction, the library has enjoyed a 
          sound fiscal policy. As your village trustee, I will ensure that the 
          village operates with sound budgetary management and fiscal responsibility.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1"><br>
          <b>Bringing Economic Development with a Vision</b><br>
          I look up and down Lincoln and Touhy Avenues and see abandoned properties 
          and unsustainable businesses. While other communities are courting upscale, 
          destination businesses like Trader Joe's, we have brought in more dry 
          cleaners and banks than any village could desire. Yet we are sending 
          long time businesses packing. Our Village is on the cusp of a major 
          redevelopment opportunity at the Purple Hotel property. Economic revitalization 
          of this dilapidated property is long overdue but redevelopment must 
          involve proper planning, design and execution. As trustee I will ensure 
          there is a long-term sustainable vision, compatibility with the surrounding 
          community, and a plan that builds our tax base and creates jobs.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1"><br>
          <b>Improving Relations with the School and Library Districts</b><br>
          Last year our Village made headlines in the press with troubles on our 
          School Board. In addition, the Village is currently contemplating the 
          passage of the largest TIF district in Village history that could seriously 
          impact future revenue to the library and school districts. Now more 
          than ever we need a trustee that considers and works with all of the 
          taxing districts in the Village. As a substitute teacher at SD74 and 
          because of my elected office at the library, I understand better than 
          any other candidate how to fix this broken relationship.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="+1"><br>
          <b>Increasing Communications with Residents</b><br>
          Our current trustees are reluctant to televise all the meetings in the 
          Village. For example, in a February Committee of the Whole meeting they 
          discussed this topic and decided not to do anything until after the 
          election. Why is this? It was stated that if residents are interested 
          they can attend in person. Maybe they don't understand that meetings 
          at 6 PM are inconvenient to attend when you are still commuting home 
          from work, or picking up your children from after school activities, 
          or making dinner for your family. As trustee I will fight to ensure 
          all public meetings are available to the entire public, whether televised, 
          streamed online, or otherwise.</font><font size="+2"><br>
