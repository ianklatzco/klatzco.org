      <p>My education and my experience focus on Public Administration and Public Service. After graduating from New Trier West High School, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Public Administration and Political Science from MacMurray College, and a Master's Degree in Teaching from National Louis University.</p>

      <p>I have been a Paramedic at the Village of Northfield and supported the assistant Village Manager.</p>

      <p>As a photojournalist, I lived, and traveled around the world. This has given me an open view of different cultures, customs and religions.</p>

      <p>I am a licensed teacher and currently a substitute in the local school districts, including SD74. I previously served as a fourth grade teacher in the Skokie School District Through this experience I have gained much respect for our SD74 teachers and staff and the quality of their work that they do.</p>

      <p>I was elected to the Lincolnwood Public Library board where I served for eight years. My roles included Treasurer and Chairman of the Finance and Facilities Committee. I successfully oversaw the Library finances, and expansion of the parking lot with an eco-friendly approach, among many other improvements. Under my stewardship, the library remained financially sound without burdening the community, all while delivering services to our diverse population.</p>

      <p>In 2013, I successfully ran for Trustee of the Village of Lincolnwood.  I am currently the Chairman of the Finance committee and the liaison to the Human Relation Commission and the Police and Fire Board.  I also serve on the Saint Francis EMS System Advisory Board.</p>
