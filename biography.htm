            <p>I am 62 years old and have been a Lincolnwood resident for over 27 years. My wife Lucyna and I have two children, Ian (20, attending U of I Champaign, studying Computer Engineering) and Eric (17, a senior at Saint Ignatius College Prep), who always make us proud and never cease to amaze us. They have been well educated by our School District 74 schools, and they have learned responsibility, leadership, and civic duty from our local Boy Scout chapter, where I am a Scout Leader.</p>

            <p>My family businesses, Novelty Golf and the Bunny Hutch at Devon and Lincoln, have been a part of Lincolnwood for over 68 years. This family-focused entertainment business has allowed me to meet many residents and local parents who bring their children first, and then come back a generation later with their grandchildren.â€¨ I am fortunate that Lincolnwood has been a part of my life in many ways.</p>

            <p>I have coached Lincolnwood baseball, been a scout leader, and been a teacher for many years.</p>

            <p>The Klatzco Family has a long tradition of supporting our community.</p>

          <p>Over the years we have supported:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Friends of the Lincolnwood Library</li>
            <li>SD 74 PTA </li>
            <li>The DARE anti-drug program in our local schools. </li>
            <li>Lincolnwood Girls Softball</li>
            <li>Lincolnwood Youth Baseball </li>
            <li>The Annual Easter Easter Egg Hunt</li>
            <li>The Annual Turkey Trot </li>
            <li>The Fraternal Order of Police </li>
            <li>The Paramedics and Fire Department </li>
