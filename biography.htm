            <p>I am 62 years old and have been a Lincolnwood resident for over 27 years. My wife Lucyna and I have two children, Ian (20, attending U of I Champaign) and Eric (17, accepted there), who always make us proud and never cease to amaze us. They have been well educated by our School District 74 schools and they learned responsibility, leadership, and civic duty from our local Boy Scout chapter, where I am a Scout Leader.</p>
            <p>My family businesses, Novelty Golf and the Bunny Hutch at Devon and Lincoln, have been a part of Lincolnwood for over 68 years. This family-focused entertainment business has allowed me to meet many residents and parents who bring their children and then a generation later bring in their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.â€¨ I am fortunate that Lincolnwood has been a part of my life in many ways.</p>
            <p>I have coached Lincolnwood baseball, been a scout leader, and taught for many years.</p>
            <p>The Klatzco Family has a long tradition of supporting our community.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Friends of the Lincolnwood Library</li>
            <li>SD 74 PTA </li>
            <li>The DARE anti-drug program in our local schools. </li>
