      <p>The fact that I live work, shop, bank, and have educated my children in Lincolnwood has given me a unique and comprehensive view of our village. I would like residents to know I serve the interests of all members of our community, not just one specific group.</p>

      <p>As trustee, I have observed fiscal responsibility, promoted economic development with a long-term vision, kept our taxes and fees low, and continued to improve relations with the School and Library Districts. I want to support local businesses, and serve the needs of our diverse population to the best of my ability.</p>

      <p>The face of Lincolnwood has changed over the years. I am fortunate to be running for re-election with Mayor Gerald Turry, Ron S. Cope and Jean Ikezoe-Halevi. These candidates have the knowledge and experience to continue improving our infrastructure, promotng economic development, and celebrating the diversity in our village. We are at a important time in our town and need leaders that are objective, open to new ideas, and willing to work together for the improvement of our community. I have had the opportunity to work with these candidates and I feel they are the best choice for Lincolnwood.</p>

      <p>As Village Trustee, my experience, education, knowledge, insight, and most of all my enthusiasm will help to continue improving the Village of Lincolnwood for all of our residents.</p>
